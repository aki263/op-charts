# OP Helm Charts
This repository contains helm charts for Optimism and Ethereum infrastructure.

## What can I do with these charts?
- You can build an OP Stack chain with a few lines of configurations.
- You can run Optimism network node easily.

## Why are you building this?
Because you probably need your own rollup at the end of the day and building on OP Stack is the best answer.

We just want to help you to onboard on the OP Stack :)

## Thanks
Thanks for OP Labs, Optimism Foundation, and Ethereum Foundation for building and open-sourcing this amazing collective and technology.
